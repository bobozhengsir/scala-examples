You will find some not really useful examples showing Scala basic syntax sugar.

These examples were developed while reading Programiming Scala (The Pragmatic Programmers).

# How to use

I've been using so far the instructions written by Toni Cebrian about how to create a Scala project template. Check this out here: http://www.tonicebrian.com/2012/02/15/scala-project-template-sbt-0-11-2/.

- Execute the tests:
```bash
sbt test
```
