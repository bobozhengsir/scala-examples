# Introduction

You will find some not really useful examples showing Scala basic syntax sugar.

These examples were developed while reading Programiming Scala (The Pragmatic Programmers).

# How to use

I've been using so far the instructions written by Toni Cebrian about [how to create a Scala project template](http://www.tonicebrian.com/2012/02/15/scala-project-template-sbt-0-11-2/).

- [Install sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup)

- Execute the tests:
```bash
sbt test
```
